# HTML Final Task

Welcome to my **HTML Final Task** repository! This project represents my understanding and application of **HTML5**, where I’ve demonstrated the ability to build a structured, interactive, and visually appealing webpage.

## 📚 Project Overview

In this project, I’ve utilized **HTML5** to create a **multi-page website** or a **single-page layout** (depending on your project's scope). The primary goal was to develop a fully functional, responsive, and well-structured web page that adheres to best practices in HTML.

### Key Features:
- **HTML Structure**: Proper usage of HTML5 semantic tags such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and others to enhance both accessibility and SEO.
- **Interactive Elements**: Form inputs, buttons, links, and navigation to ensure users can interact with the page.
- **Responsive Design**: Media queries used to ensure the website is mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Styling (CSS)**: Application of basic CSS to design the layout and visual elements of the webpage.
- **JavaScript (Optional)**: If applicable, JavaScript may have been used to add interactivity such as form validation, modals, or dynamic content loading.

## 🔧 Technologies Used:
- **HTML5**: For creating the structure of the website.
- **CSS3**: For styling the website and ensuring it’s visually appealing and responsive.
- **JavaScript** (Optional): For adding interactive features and client-side logic (e.g., form validation, animations).
- **Bootstrap** (Optional): If included, for creating a responsive design quickly using pre-designed components.
- **Fonts & Icons** (Optional): Use of external fonts (like Google Fonts) and icons (like Font Awesome) for improved typography and aesthetics.

## 🚀 Features:
- **Responsive Layout**: The webpage adjusts smoothly from large desktop screens to smaller mobile devices. This feature improves the user experience by making the site accessible on any device.
- **Navigation**: Includes a navigation bar for easy movement between sections or pages of the site.
- **Forms**: Input forms for gathering user data, whether it be for a contact form, survey, or other applications.
- **Interactive Components**: JavaScript-driven elements (e.g., buttons that change state, forms that validate input, or a photo gallery).
- **Semantic HTML**: Use of meaningful HTML tags, ensuring the webpage is accessible and SEO-friendly.

## 📈 Testing:
**To test the website:**

Open the index.html file in your browser.
Check responsiveness: Resize the browser window to test if the website adjusts appropriately to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Test interactivity: Fill out forms, click buttons, or interact with any JavaScript-driven components (if applicable).
